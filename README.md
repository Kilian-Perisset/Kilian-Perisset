### Hi there 👋

I'm Kilian Périsset, here are some things on me : 
- 🔭 I’m currently working as an Android developer
- 🎯 The languages I use(d) are the following : `Kotlin`, `Java` (a bit, but I definitely prefer Kotlin), `Javascript` (Node.js - Express, Angular), `C#`, `PHP` and surely others that I didn't write.
- 🧪 I’m currently having fun with `Flutter` (Dart) and I'm experimenting certain things on it.
- ⚡ My points of interest : 🎮🐶🏍
